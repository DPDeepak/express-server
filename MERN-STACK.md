# MERN-STACK
The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React / Redux, and Node.js.

## MangoDB
* MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.
* An open source document database that provides persistence for application data.

* Database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system.
* A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases.
* Designed with scalability and developer agility in mind.
## Express web framework of Node.js:
* Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
* Basically runs the backend code as a module within the Node.js environment.
* Handles the routing of requests to the right parts of your app.
## React.js:
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
* A JavaScript library developed by Facebook to build interactive / reactive interfaces.
* It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
* React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
## Node.js:
* Node.js is an open source server environment
* Node.js is free
* Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
* Node.js uses JavaScript on the server
* Node.js uses asynchronous programming

Here is how Node.js handles a file request:
* Sends the task to the computer's file system.
* Ready to handle the next request.
* When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
